    "Heart disease is the world's leading cause of death, claiming approximately 18 million lives each year, as reported by the World Health Organization. Predictive models like logistic regression can enable early identification of at-risk patients by analyzing clinical features such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. This not only improves treatment outcomes but also optimizes resource allocation in healthcare settings. In this homework, you'll implement logistic regression on the Heart Disease Dataset—a real-world UCI repository collection of 303 patient records with 14 features and a binary target (1 for disease presence, 0 for absence). You'll train models, visualize boundaries, apply regularization, and explore deployment via Amazon SageMaker to mimic a production pipeline."
